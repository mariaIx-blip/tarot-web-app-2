Empress: 'The secret is actually pretty simple. Give it care, love and time. Trust the process, and yes, I know that trusting the process can feel scary and annoying, but it will blossom with inspiration and creativity. Sometimes it is not about the end, but about enjoying the way.'

Emperor: 'It looks like there is no other way than discipline. Do not tell yourself you do not have what it takes, because you most certainly do. This calls for stability, leadership and focus, and sometimes it might feel impossible. Make a plan, trust your decisions, and take charge. Strength and wisdom will come from your own power.'

Hierophant: 'So, you feel like you cannot find either the head or tail? That is because truth is not always obvious, it often comes through learning and experiences. Step back, see it from a higher perspective (try to think as a bird.. or a soul) and you will start to notice the patterns and answers. Maybe in ways you do not expect, but in the end, it will all make sense.'

Lovers: 'Well, hate to break it to you, but if you really want it, you have to say yes. Commit! With your head, heart and soul. Do not just let it be: Let me see what happens or: If it happens, it happens. Align yourself with what you truly want, and you will get it. Commitment takes courage, but the opposite is losing. So, do you want it or not?'

Chariot: 'I am gonna say something annoying now, but... do not let fear of failure stop you. Moving forward is already success. You cannot lose as long as you have determination for momentum, I know it sounds insane, but you should try it! Even if the path feels unclear or heavy at times, keep going. The right path is the one you create for yourself.'

Strength:'You think you are weak? Really? Think again! Strength is not about fighting harder. Raw power? No thanks. You don’t have to roar like a lion to prove yourself. True strength shows in the resilient smile, the quiet flicker of courage that refuses to quit and the light you keep shining, even when others cast shadows. Yes, you are far more powerful than you realize.'

Hermit: 'All those voices and opinions, they are pretty loud, huh? But you do not need them. Take some time alone and reflect on what really matters. You might be surprised how good your own company is! Wisdom grows in the quiet, not in everyone else’s advice. Try it, give yourself a day alone, you might find out it will be the best one yet.'

Wheel of Fortune: 'Guess what? Life is more like a circle than a straight line. The good, the bad, the: Oh not this again! It all comes around in cycles. But here is the trick: Nothing is wasted. Even what feels wrong today can turn into the blessing you only notice later. What I am saying? Well, just.. trust life.'

Justice: 'What goes around comes around, right? Karma is not bad, it is just your own efforts coming back to meet you. Actions yes, but also intentions. Justice will be served. Maybe you already have a clear vision of what you want, and that is great! But stay open. Be your most authentic self, and you will either get exactly what you seek, or something even better.'

Hanged Man: 'Stagnation and pausing, what could be good about that? Well, think of it this way: Is it easier to stand on your head while standing still or while running? You cannot see things from a new perspective if you rush past this blessing of a pause. What is so wrong with sitting and watching the wind in the trees? You might get insights… or at least a calmer nervous system.'

Death: 'Ooooh, lucky you, it is transformation time! This is your call to shed old patterns, habits, beliefs or what else that weighs you down. What exactly? That is your job to figure out! On the other side waits a fresher, lighter, more aligned version of you. Yes, it takes reflection and dedication, but the rebirth will be worth it.'

Temperance: 'Well, balance is the key. Is it difficult? Yes. Is it worth it? Absolutely. Whether it’s your attention, actions, emotions, thoughts, or anything else in your life, it can really benefit from a little patience. Patience is your friend! It helps you stay steady, find your balance and flow with life. I know you know its true: Patience and balance will carry you far.'
